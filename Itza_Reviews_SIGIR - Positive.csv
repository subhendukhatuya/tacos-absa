Itza_POS_1,17-Aug-19,Aug-19,1,August,August,Our tour guide Jesus and Juan Pablo were amazing they gave us a lot of background and the experience was once in a lifetime the swim in the Cenote was awesome definitely bring water shoes and do the jump what a feeling only thing I would change is empty out the bathroom from the bus while we are seeing the temple at the end it was bad .,,,,,,
Itza_POS_2,16-Aug-19,Jul-19,7,August,July,Must do as early morning trip . We left hotel at 5am and got there before the crowds and the heat . Incredible place with so many stories . Our guide was fantastic and showed us so many unique things from clapping in front of the temple to whispering on the wind and being heard 200 metres away . The history of the place is amazing and there is plenty of bird and animal life around . Plenty to see and take in . We left around midday and it was getting REAL hot !,Itza_POS_2_1: Must do as early morning trip .,,,,,
